        "I am a dedicated PhD student at Aarhus University's Section for Orofacial Pain and Jaw Function within the Department of Dentistry and Oral Health. My research focuses on the epigenetic and nutritional risk factors for painful temporomandibular disorders (TMD). With a strong background in dentistry and specialization in oral medicine, I am committed to advancing my expertise in orofacial pain.",
        "My journey began with a DDS from Kerman University of Medical Sciences in Iran, followed by a top-ranked postgraduate degree in Oral Medicine. I have practiced clinically, treating patients with oral mucosal diseases, orofacial pain, and TMD. My current research aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms of TMD to improve patient outcomes and contribute to the field's knowledge base."
